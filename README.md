# Title

Updated Portfolio


# Description

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. In this assignment Iâ€™ll set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
